# ML-coursera-andrew-ng-python

I am currently working on the ML course by Andrew Ng available on coursera  (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). But, considering it is an old course, I am doing the assignments in python instead of Octave or MATLAB.

This is the repository of the jupyter notebook of my assignment implementations. Though I implemented them few months ago, I am adding explanations to them and uploading them now.
